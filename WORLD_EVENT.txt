How To Trigger The Event:
     -Click on any part of the world.

What Should Happen:
     -Radioactive chemicals spread across a small range of cells.
     -Parasites spawn on cetain tiles as long as those tiles are in bounds and not occupied.
     -If a Miner (full / not full) walks on top of one of the radioactive squares, a Miner turns into a ZombieMiner.

What Affected Entities Do:
     -The ParasiteOreBlobs, along with the parasites, attack other OreBlobs to transform the OreBlobs into ParasiteOreBlobs.
     -A ZombieMiner targets only MinerFulls, because ZombieMiners are attracted to large collections of Ore and a MinerFull carries a lot of Ore
      on the way back to a Blacksmith. A ZombieMiner turns a MinerFull into a ZombieMiner.

New Entity & Behavior:
     -Parasite: Finds an OreBlob to attack and transforms it into a ParasiteOreBlob. Typically initiates a large chain of ParasiteOreBlobs.
