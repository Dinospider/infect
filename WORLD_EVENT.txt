How To Trigger The Event:  Click on any part of the world.  
-What Should Happen:  Radioactive chemicals spread across a small range of cells. Parasites may spawn. If a Miner (full / not full) walks on top of one of the radio-active squares, a Miner turns into a ZombieMiner. 
-What Affected Entities Do:  The ParasiteOreBlobs, along with the parasites, attack other OreBlobs to form ParasiteOreBlobs. A ZombieMiner targets only MinerFulls, because ZombieMiners are attracted to large collections of Ore and a MinerFull carries a lot of Ore on the way back to a Blacksmith. A ZombieMiner turns a MinerFull into a ZombieMiner.  
-New Entity & Behavior  Parasite - Finds an OreBlob to attack and turn into a Parasite OreBlob. Typically initiates a large chain of ParasiteOreBlobs.
