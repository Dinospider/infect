Ambigious Methods:

getImage() - debated if to move to both entity and background and overload, but decided to keep in world because it is accessed there.

rand - Moved to Entity because it was used only by Entity

scheduleActions() - Initially kept in EventScheduler, but moved to Entity so that entities can schedule their own actions.

adjacent() - Moved to point class because it was the adjacency between two points, and that was best represented by the point class itself.

All create__entity() - Put as static methods in Entity
